### Hello and welcome to my website!

So... you have found your way here.  
A little about me... My name is Alexander, but I go by Alex or Kali (military and friend nickname). 

### Little overview
I love all things technical and mechanical. I started at a young age taking computers apart. This turned into me experimenting with other things such as small engines on motorcycles, then moving up to V10s and some V12s.  

### Music
Music is something that runs deep within my personality. I mainly listen to a bunch of EDM (Above & Beyond, Edward Maya, Eric Prydz, and Jacob Plant, to name a few...). I do dabble in other genres as I am usually open to listening to them. Country is my least favorite genre unless it is old school.

### Charlie
<!-- I have a little cat named Charlie and she is 3 years old (turning 4 in August). She is adorable in every way and is a very big part of my life. With her, I feel unstoppable. She helps me with my tech issues and debugging my server rack. -->
As of May 2023, Charlie has passed away. This was due to a problem with kidney stones. She meant the world to me, and it was hard to accept that she has passed. It is actually still hard for me to swallow that fact still. I was considering of taking down this photo as it makes it hard for me to believe it still. I decided against it as it is a reminder that I will always love her and miss her.

### Education
I graduated from the University of Nebraska - Omaha with a bachelorâ€™s in Cyber Security and a minor in Computer Science. I currently know 5 languages (French, Russian, German, Romanian, and English), but not fluent within speaking 4 of them. I can decently read and write them.

I currently hold a Security+ certification. My plan in 2024 is to obtain CASP+, CISSP, and OSCP.

### Hobbies
Last thing, I have way too <u>many</u> hobbies. I love being active and keeping myself busy. Sitting still isn't a thing for me. I strive for success and from those that know me, will say I am too passionate about success.  

Stick around to learn more about what I want to do! ðŸ˜„

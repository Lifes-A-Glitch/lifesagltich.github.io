SSH keys can be used in remote version control/file storage sites such as github, bitbucket, and gitlab (there are others out there as well). They can also be used to log into remote servers as well. There are many practical uses for SSH keys, but for now we are going to focus on generating the keys.

First pulling out the R630s was easy enough. The R730XD on the other hand was a nightmare to handle Next was the switches/router. The USW-48-PoE was a little more complicated. I had to remove the power from the UDMP-SE and then remove the power from the USW-48-PoE. I thought I could just tear down the server rack ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Steam Deck: Legacy Created</title><link href="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Steam Deck: Legacy Created" /><published>2022-08-12T11:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-08-13T15:03:26-06:00</updated> <id>https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck/</id> <content src="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck/" /> <author> <name>Alex</name> </author> <category term="Tech Projects" /> <summary> Steam Deck Pt. 2 - SteamOS and Games I have had the steam deck for only a few days now. It is one of the best handheld consoles that you can own to date. The potential that is has is going to shake the console industry for years. I know there are other consoles out there like it. This one though… is an entire different ballpark of it’s own. Different Operating Systems So far, I have seen peop... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Steam Deck: Arrival &amp; Modification</title><link href="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck-Arrival/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Steam Deck: Arrival &amp; Modification" /><published>2022-07-26T19:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-08-28T19:22:39-06:00</updated> <id>https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck-Arrival/</id> <content src="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Steam-Deck-Arrival/" /> <author> <name>Alex</name> </author> <category term="Tech Projects" /> <summary> What I Want To Do… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ With my Steam Deck being on it’s way, I want to talk about its potential. Starting with “hacking”, I want to try to load Kali Linux (a popular flavor of Linux) onto the Steam Deck and see if I can get it to work. If so, I want to know what the potential it has in store when it comes to breaching security measures using the system. I would also like to see if emulato... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reddit Bot: Scraping Subthreads</title><link href="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Reddit-Bot/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reddit Bot: Scraping Subthreads" /><published>2022-07-04T19:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-07-26T22:31:36-06:00</updated> <id>https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Reddit-Bot/</id> <content src="https://blog.lifesaglitch.tech/posts/Reddit-Bot/" /> <author> <name>Alex</name> </author> <category term="Reddit-Bot" /> <summary> Details Details Details… To explain why I am even talking about this is because one day I got miffed that I could not get an invite for something I wanted on a subreddit of Reddit. I wanted to know when someone was to make a post, and I could connect it via keywords. At that point in time, the bot would notify me via SMS. That is the plan at least. This bot was designed to scrape any subredd... </summary> </entry> </feed>

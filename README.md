### Installation of Ruby and other requirements:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
# Chirpy Starter

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/jekyll-theme-chirpy)][gem]&nbsp;
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cotes2020/chirpy-starter.svg?color=blue)][mit]

When installing the [**Chirpy**][chirpy] theme through [RubyGems.org][gem], Jekyll can only read files in the folders
`_data`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets`, as well as a small part of options of the `_config.yml` file
from the theme's gem. If you have ever installed this theme gem, you can use the command
`bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy` to locate these files.

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```
### Configuration of Ruby Gems (do not want to install them as root user)
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc &&
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc &&
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && 
source ~/.bashrc
```
### Install bundler
```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
```
### Running Jekyll-Based site
 You will want to run the command:
 ```shell
 bundle
 ```
 just to make sure that gems dependencies are installed and checked.

 To execute and serve (locally) a Jekyll site, run:
 ```shell
 bundle exec jekyll serve
 ```

 ### Notes:

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of
the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.


Sign in to GitHub and [**use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it
`USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```console
$ bundle
```

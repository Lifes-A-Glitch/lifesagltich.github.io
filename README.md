echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc &&
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc &&
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && 
source ~/.bashrc
```
### Install bundler
```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
```
### Running Jekyll-Based site
 You will want to run the command:
 ```shell
 bundle
 ```
 just to make sure that gems dependencies are installed and checked.

 To execute and serve (locally) a Jekyll site, run:
 ```shell
 bundle exec jekyll serve
 ```

 ### Notes:

 You may have to change the permissions of the directory you hold your repo in.
 If it looks like: `drwxrwxrwx 1 root 197609 0 Jun 18 22:23 {placeholder}.github.io/`, you will need to use `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER <filepath>`## Installation


[**Use this template**][use-template] to generate a brand new repository and name it `<GH_USERNAME>.github.io`, where `GH_USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

Then clone it to your local machine and run:

```
$ bundle
```

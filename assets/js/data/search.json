SSH keys can be used in remote version control/file storage sites such as github, bitbucket, and gitlab (there are others out there as well). They can also be used to log into remote servers as well. There are many practical uses for SSH keys, but for now we are going to focus on generating the keys. On this page, I will also mention how to add the keys to the ssh-agent.Over time I will update this page to include setting up Github (and other repo services), as well as ssh‚Äôing into remote servers.EncryptionThere are different types of encryptions when it comes to SSH keys.Those keys are: RSA DSA ECDSA EDDSA ED25519Choosing an Algorithm and Key SizeSSH supports several public key algorithms for authentication keys. Listed below are the most common algorithms.RSARSA is the most commonly used form of encryption, but larger keys do require more time to generate.RSA is considered a part of the specialized algorithms (Quadratic Sieve &amp;amp; General Number Field Seive exists to factor the integers).A key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended for RSA; 4096 bits is better. RSA is getting old and significant advances are being made in factoring updates for it. Choosing a different algorithm may be advisable, and it is quite possible the RSA algorithm will become practically breakable in the foreseeable future. All SSH clients support this algorithm.DSAIt has notoriety for security issues which makes it less popular. It has faster signature generation, but it is slow for validation. It also requires the use of randomly generated, unpredictable, and secure value that, if discovered, will reveal the private key.ECDSAECDSA is fairly new but not as popular as EDDSA.Public keys are twitch the length of the desired bit security.Vulnerable if the pseudo random number aren‚Äôt cryptographically strong.This is probably a good algorithm for current applications. Only three key sizes are supported: 256, 384, and 521 (sic!) bits. We would recommend always using it with 521 bits, since the keys are still small and probably more secure than the smaller keys (even though they should be safe as well). Most SSH clients now support this algorithm.EDDSAVery new, and favored by most modern cryptographic libraries.Performance wise, they are actually the fastest algorithm across the spectrum. It provides the highest level of security when compared to key length. It also improves on the insecurities found in ECDSA. (I will not be showing the ssh-keygen command for it‚Ä¶ for now)ED25519This is a new algorithm added in OpenSSH. Support for it in clients is not yet universal. Thus its use in general purpose applications may not yet be advisable.Command ExamplesThe algorithm is selected using the -t option and key size using the -b option. The following commands illustrate:ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096ssh-keygen -t dsa ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521ssh-keygen -t ed25519testedGenerating SSH Keys (Github, but could be used for others)You do not need to open this in git bash but I highly recommend it. CMD could not work but I have not tried with that yet.For this tutorial I will be using the ed25519 algorithm.First you will want to generate an SSH-Key:$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;I recommend putting in your email address and not leaving the quotes there. Ex: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C johdoe@gmail.com.This will create a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. What is shown: Generating public/private algorithm key pair.When you are prompted to ‚ÄúEnter a file in which to save the key‚Äù, press Enter. This will allow the file to end up in the default file location: ~/.ssh/.At the prompt, type a secure passphrase (you honestly do not need to type in a password if you do not want to), and press ‚ÄòEnter‚Äô.Adding your SSH Key to the ssh-agentBefore adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for an existing SHH key and generated a new SSH key. Ensure the ssh-agent is running.# start the ssh-agent in the background$ eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;&amp;gt; Agent pid &amp;lt;different number every time&amp;gt; Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519Notes: Every time you have a problem with SSH keys, make sure to start up the SSH agent and also add the key back.New song to listen to:Thank you for reading this small post, here is some music!Revision 0.1 - 8/28/2022: Initial Upload" }, { "title": "Homelab: Teardown Of The Lab", "url": "/posts/Teardown-Of-Doom/", "categories": "Homelab", "tags": "Homelab, R630, R730, R730XD, UDMP-SE, USW-48-PoE, Raspberry Pi", "date": "2022-08-12 11:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "The ‚ÄúWreckoning‚Äù of the LabToday was the day that I started tearing down my lab.

It is one of the best handheld consoles that you can own to date. The potential that is has is going to shake the console industry for years. I know there are other consoles out there like it. This one though‚Ä¶ is an entire different ballpark of it‚Äôs own.Different Operating SystemsSo far, I have seen people load Windows 11, and 10 onto their Steam Decks. I have not, I am more geared towards the linux side of it. Loading Kali Linux on it was a great experience (I will talk about this more‚Ä¶). The onboard Wi-Fi module and bluetooth make it the perfect tool for war driving and other fun stuff! I really want to try other flavors of linux and see what the potential is (I will report back findings if I like it enough).ExperienceI played around with SteamOS (Arch linux derivative) and actually enjoyed it! Though it does have some flaws (when not connected to Wi-Fi, the trackpads cannot be used as a mouse üòÜ), all around it was a good Operating System. I quickly loaded some custom loaders I created in C, and I was able to get Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess up and loading. It worked flawlessly, and the graphics were absolutely beautiful. Now I am just waiting for Nintendo to send me a cease and desist letter ü§£ (before anyone thinks I am doing something illegal, it is legal to have the ROM/Game files of a game you physically own and emulate it. Don‚Äôt be killjoys.).Now with Kali Linux‚Ä¶ The operating system on its own merit was extremely quick and responsive. Since the drivers for some things on the deck didn‚Äôt exist, I had to track one thing down but the rest were easily picked up with a update of the OS. I did not war drive with deck, though it is very much so able to do with it. I did test out my network, as well as the networks of neighbors that I lived around. With the right software, you can definitely crack into most of the routers/AP‚Äôs that surround my place. Most people do not change the password and even though it may be mixed, a few hours using jack the ripper to brute force it is easy. That being said, the deck itself is a very complicated but fun tool to have.Recommendations:I do recommend anyone that loves emulation of even gaming in general to pick one up.A list of things to consider: Definitely recommend waiting to get a better SSD from Micron. They are supposed to release a 2TB SSD that fits the deck perfectly (hasn‚Äôt been officially announced). GET THE HALL SENSING JOYSTICKS‚Ä¶ They are worth it. Better accuracy. Recommend: Hall Sensing Joysticks There is an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù docking station for the Steam Deck‚Ä¶ I recommend it, first of all. It just looks so nice. Recommend: Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck HB0603 Get a good, and stable, SD card. You will want 1TB so you can have more games load from the SD card. There is not really a performance issue from it by the way. Sandisk Extreme Pro 1TBSo far, that is all I can recommend.ConclusionThat is really all currently it! I cannot really say anything bad about the Steam Deck. The ONLY thing I would‚Äôve loved to see is an anodized-black aluminum backside that could help with heat transference. That may not work though considering that the deck does reach a good temp while playing a AAA game.New song to listen to:Something to just chill out too, because if you are reading this, you are probably already chillin‚Äô.Revision 0.1 - 8/12/2022: Initial UploadRevision 0.2 - 8/13/2022: Added reference links for product recommendations" }, { "title": "Steam Deck: Arrival &amp; Modification", "url": "/posts/Steam-Deck-Arrival/", "categories": "Tech Projects", "tags": "Steam Deck", "date": "2022-07-26 19:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "What I Want To Do‚Ä¶ ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬ØWith my Steam Deck being on it‚Äôs way, I want to talk about its potential. Starting with ‚Äúhacking‚Äù, I want to try to load Kali Linux (a popular flavor of Linux) onto the Steam Deck and see if I can get it to work. If so, I want to know what the potential it has in store when it comes to breaching security measures using the system. I would also like to see if emulators can be ran fully on a steam deck without any problems as well as to see if the controllers related to the games themselves can be used virtually. I would also like to see if the Steam Deck can be used as a virtual machine.The Steam Deck is coming here shortly, and I cannot be more excited!I still have plans for trying out Kali Linux on it. I have thought about benchmarking it with different OS‚Äôs but have not made my mind up yet. More or less, I would just like to play around with it first. I have gotten addicted to this game called Factorio and it is a blast! I am still looking forward to other games that I can play on it. Like Spy Fox (childhood nostalgia), Planetary Annihilation: TITANS, Witcher, and a few others for example.Overall, this is going to become a very powerful asset to my backpack of tools.

Proxmox in its essence is an open-source plateform that allows the virtualization of any (if not, most) operating systems. The virtualization of them are called VMs (virtual machines), and also supports containers (like VMs but more lightweight).In all honesty, it is an alright hypervisor (general software that allows virtualization). I prefer VMware‚Äôs ESXi honestly since it is more robust and allows for greater features in my perspective. Then again, Proxmox is completely new to me.Actual ProblemI am having a very hard time wrapping my head around the GUI (Graphical User Interface, basically a ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù that you access through an IP). It doesn‚Äôt seem that complicated but it still is. I don‚Äôt necessarily like it honestly. It is so far out of my stretch and I am thinking of transferring back to ESXi. I know that Proxmox itself uses less system resources than ESXi since it is open source; this also means it requires less resourcesI am unsure at this point in time how I can get used to the GUI. There are other things that took me awhile to understand in the first place like how to make a storage pool to hold data in. I had no idea that my SSDs that I had in the server were already formatted in ZFS (type of filesystem format). I then formatted them and cleared them of the ZFS it was set with. I was then able to make a pool.Okay‚Ä¶ Actual Problem AgainThe actual problem now is the fact I cannot spin up a VM without messing up the IP addresses and trying to connect it to the internet.What I Understand &amp;amp; The PlanWhat I want to do with Proxmox is run 2 VMs to run multiple services on. One VM will be designated for internal services that do not need to be reached from the outside (but may still have internet connection, still unsure about this), and external services (websites, VPNs, and other stuff). These ‚Äúservices‚Äù will be set up in the VMs as Docker Containers (I am not explaining, it is a ton of information already). Those containers will house everything, and I personally have to get better at networking when it comes to that. I need more experience within virtual networking and phyiscial networking.New song to listen to:Honestly love this song, listen to it whenever I am hacking anything. Think of it as a pump up song.

This would be localized to my network. I can have a VPN client on the RPi Zero which I can have a VPN server at my house then!

Wi-Fi - allows for either checking to see if it is connected to the internet, or allows for the user to answer the password (can be tasking‚Ä¶).

Storage of the information of the IP addresses and MAC addresses could be difficult. It could be in a file which we just parse it out, or just straight hard-coded (which is not a good idea if I want this to be secure). Either with the OLED Screen or the TFT screen, this can be accomplished. I would prefer the TFT screen mainly on the fact that it is color, and the fact that it is square which would make the design of this more simple.It is also a very good idea to try and make this a password protected so that if it timed out, you would have to input a specific combination to gain access to the program. I am thinking roughly 30 seconds of timeout is a good space to do so.Another thing is, if this is going to be portable, I am thinking of incorporating a battery into it and a battery meter as well. I believe that would be more liking as I wouldn‚Äôt have to carry a battery pack and try to convert it for the usage itself. I will just have to take into account on how much power everything will draw.

# The "Wreckoning" of the Lab
Today was the day that I started tearing down my lab. First pulling out the R630s was easy enough. The R730XD on the other hand was a nightmare to handle
Next was the switches/router. The USW-48-PoE was a little more complicated. I had to remove the power from the UDMP-SE and then remove the power from the USW-48-PoE.
I thought I could just tear down the server rack completely, but I was wrong by a long shot. I started looking around and noticed that the rack itself is welded. The whole frame was welded... I did not account for this when I purchased it as I thought I was going to be at my 1-bedroom apartment for at least awhile.
I started panicking a little, then I started measuring... The rack just *barely* sits at 6'7". I have a crazy idea to ***actually*** try to shove it in my closet... We are going to make this work. I am not giving up my rack (Man, I really need to rethink how I word stuff).

# New song to listen to:

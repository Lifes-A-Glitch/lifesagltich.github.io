# Steam Deck Pt. 2 - SteamOS and Games

I have had the steam deck for only a few days now. It is one of the best handheld consoles that you can own to date. The potential that is has is going to shake the console industry for years. I know there are other consoles out there like it.**This one though**... is an entire different ballpark of it's own. 

## Different Operating Systems
So far, I have seen people load Windows 11, and 10 onto their Steam Decks. I have not, I am more geared towards the linux side of it. Loading Kali Linux on it was a great experience (I will talk about this more...). The onboard Wi-Fi module and bluetooth make it the perfect tool for war driving and other fun stuff! I really want to try other flavors of linux and see what the potential is (I will report back findings if I like it enough).

## Experience
I played around with SteamOS (Arch linux derivative) and actually enjoyed it! Though it does have some flaws (when not connected to Wi-Fi, the trackpads cannot be used as a mouse ðŸ˜†), all around it was a good Operating System. I quickly loaded some custom loaders I created in C, and I was able to get Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess up and loading. It worked flawlessly, and the graphics were absolutely beautiful. Now I am just waiting for Nintendo to send me a cease and desist letter ðŸ¤£ (Before anyone thinks I am doing something illegal, it is legal to have the ROM/Game files of a game you physically own and emulate it. Don't be killjoys.).

*Now with Kali Linux*... The operating system on its own merit was extremely quick and responsive. Since the drivers for some things on the deck didn't exist, I had to track one thing down but the rest were easily picked up with a update of the OS. I did not war drive with deck, though it is very much so able to do with it. 
I ***did*** test out my network, as well as the networks of neighbors that I lived around. With the right software, you can definitely crack into most of the routers/AP's that surround my place. Most people do not change the password and even though it may be mixed, a few hours using jack the ripper to brute force it is easy. 
That being said, the deck itself is a very complicated but fun tool to have.

### Recommendations:
I do recommend anyone that loves emulation of even gaming in general to pick one up.

A list of things to consider:
<!-- TODO: Will need to add links for recommendations -->
+ Definitely recommend waiting to get a better SSD from Micron. They are supposed to release a 2TB SSD that fits the deck perfectly (hasn't been announced).
+ GET THE HALL EFFECT JOYSTICKS... They are worth it. Better accuracy.
+ There is an "official" docking station for the Steam Deck... I recommend it, first of all. It just looks so nice.
+ Get a good, *and stable*, SD card. You will want 1TB so you can have more games load from the SD card. There is not really a performance issue from it by the way.

So far, that is all I can recommend.

## Conclusion
That is really all currently it! I cannot really say anything bad about the Steam Deck. The **ONLY** thing I would've loved to see is an anodized-black aluminum backside that could help with heat transference. That may not work though considering that the deck does reach a good temp while playing a AAA game.

Something to just chill out too, because if you are reading this, you are probably already chillin'.

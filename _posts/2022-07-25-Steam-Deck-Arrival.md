# What I Want To Do... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
With my Steam Deck being on it's way, I want to talk about its potential. Starting with "hacking", I want to try to load Kali Linux (a popular flavor of Linux) onto the Steam Deck and see if I can get it to work. If so, I want to know what the potential it has in store when it comes to breaching security measures using the system. I would also like to see if emulators can be ran fully on a steam deck without any problems as well as to see if the controllers related to the games themselves can be used virtually. I would also like to see if the Steam Deck can be used as a virtual machine.

The Steam Deck is coming here shortly, and I cannot be more excited!
I still have plans for trying out Kali Linux on it. I have thought about benchmarking it with different OS's but have not made my mind up yet. More or less, I would just like to play around with it first. I have gotten addicted to this game called Factorio and it is a blast! I am still looking forward to other games that I can play on it. Like Spy Fox (childhood nostalgia), Planetary Annihilation: TITANS, Witcher, and a few others for example.

Overall, this is going to become a very powerful asset to my backpack of tools. I am going to be able to use it to hack computers, and I am going to be able to use it to play games on it.
*Hopefully it comes here in one piece!*

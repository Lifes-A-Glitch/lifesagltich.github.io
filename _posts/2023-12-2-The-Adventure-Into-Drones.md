# What exactly are you talking about, Alex?
Well... I am talking about big fire-y flying things

## What are drones?
In a simple answer, drones are flying robots. They are used for many things, such as taking pictures, delivering packages, and even fighting wars. They are also used for fun, such as racing and flying around. Drones can be powered from anything, such as fuel to battery driven. The type of drones most people will see are called Quadcopters as they have 4 individual motors attached to a frame in an X formation majority of the time. There are other types of formations which we will cover in other posts.

## Parts of my drone
I recently just purchased everything for my personal drone, but here is the list!
The drone itself:
- [DJI O3 Air Unit - $229.00*](https://www.dji.com/o3-air-unit)
  - The reason why I specifically picked this is because of the HD video it relays back to the goggles (which DJi is proprietary... don't expect much). It also allows me to record solely on the camera itself. It will allow me to record in 4k/120fps which is great for what this drone is specifically for.
- [GEP-CL35 V2 Frame - $69.99*](https://geprc.com/product/gep-cl35-v2-frame/)
  - This frame will allow me to use the O3 Air Unit and a GoPro (or other action cam). This is also built for more steady and slow flying. This would be considered a cinewhoop frame.
- [GEPRC SPEEDX2 2105.5 2650 KV - $21.99*](https://geprc.com/product/geprc-speedx2-2105-5-2650kv-3450kv-motor/)
  - I got 5 of these little suckers. Reasons being is because if a motor gets damaged, I can at least swap out a motor and continue on flying. These motors are known to be good at handling, as well as agressively stable in terms of power. Good for a light cruise, and getting on the gas.
- [GEPRC GEP-F722-45A AIO V2 - $109.99*](https://geprc.com/product/geprc-gep-f722-45a-aio/)
  - The flight controller boasts a continuous current of 45A (55A for short bursts) which is perfect for smooth cruises. Also has 5 full UART ports that allow connection of exteneral devices. It supports 2-6s batteries as well. Honestly, the only reason why I can't choose another flight controller is because GEP sorta locks down everything... which I will have to be picky with later. 
- [HQProp DT90MMX3 3.5 inch 90mm Propeller - $2.99*](https://geprc.com/product/hqprop-dt90mmx3-3-5-inch-90mm-propeller/)
  - I actually bought 2 packs of these because I am afraid that I will mess up the props so I just bought 2 to make sure I have extras.
- [RP1 ExpressLRS 2.4ghz Nano Receiver - $18.99*](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/rp1-expresslrs-2-4ghz-nano-receiver)
  - This is the receiver (duhh, it says it right in the name...) for the drone itself. I got the FCC variant because LBT isn't really needed unless you are in the EU. ELRS will be explained later.

What I (the pilot) will have:
- [Ranger Micro 2.4GHZ ELRS Module](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/ranger-micro-2-4ghz-elrs-module)
  - Okay, remember what I said about ELRS? It is pretty appealing to me honestly. This module is for the radiomaster TX16S MkII that I have. The reason why I wanted this module is because it outputs 1W (1000mW) instead of the 250mW that my controller (I could be wrong about this...) puts out. More power, more range (as well as penetration).
- [DJI Goggles 2 - $519*](https://store.dji.com/product/dji-goggles-2?vid=127611)
  - **The goggles are soooooooo nice.** ðŸ¤¤ <br>
  Anyways, the googles themselves are proprietary to DJI only sadly. There are a few FPV cameras from DJI that are [supported under these googles](https://oscarliang.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dji-compatibility-goggles-2-v1-v2-O3-Air-Unit-vista-link-remote-controller-avata-drone-update-feb-2023.jpg). The true reason why I got these is because of the Micro-OLED screens, the 100Hz support, and pairs extremely well with the O3 Air Unit.
- [Radiomaster TX16S MkII - $379.99*](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller?variant=42817741324519)
  - The version I got came with the AG01 Hall Gimbals, ELRS, and region FCC. I wanted the gimbals mainly as well as ELRS. I know I got a ELRS module, but the controller only supports up to 250mW.

- Extra batteries - Batteries that fit your specific quad(s).
- Toolkit for quick fixes


\* - Everything at the time of upload of this page is the current price of what I bought it at. The prices listed may not reflect what is currently in store. 

## The plan for the future
I plan on making a post about building the drone and steps of doing so. Hopefully it will be more indepth. It will include all the parts listed in this post and potentially more. Still ordering.

I will also go further into drones and what different use cases are, what types of drones, and how they can be useful. I will also start writing about drone related news.

# What exactly are you talking about, Alex?
Well... I am talking about being fire-y flying things

## What are drones?
In a simple answer, drones are flying robots. They are used for many things, such as taking pictures, delivering packages, and even fighting wars. They are also used for fun, such as racing and flying around. Drones can be powered from anything, such as fuel to battery driven. The type of drones most people will see are called Quadcopters as they have 4 individual motors attached to a frame in an X formation majority of the time. There are other types of formations which we will get down to later.

## How do they work?
<!-- The [Radio Master Zorro](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/zorro-radio-controller) tends to be the best starter considering it's balance of form to function. The form of it is similar to a Playstation controller. With hobbyists, they prefer a more square and box-like controller like the [Radio Master tx12](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx12-radio-controller). The tx12 is the box-y controller that most hobbyists recommend.  -->
